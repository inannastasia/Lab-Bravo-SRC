The Shoals Root Current (SRC) is a community platform bridging the historic Muscle Shoals music legacy with today's local artists and events. This wireframe maps out the homepage as a 'Digital Town Square' with sections for listening to music, finding local events, and supporting the movement through sponsorships. I used Lovable.dev to bring the wireframe to life as an interactive prototype.
